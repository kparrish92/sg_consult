# Analysis 

The analysis is broken into sections. The first concerns the most important 5 questions that should be directly affected by the lesson. 


## Most important 5 questions:

1. How much do you like the idea of being/becoming bilingual? `becoming_bilingual`

2. Even if the other person knows both languages, how rude is it to switch between languages in a conversation? (reverse coded) `codeswitch_rude`

3. How important is Spanish in the United States? `important_spanish`

4. How valuable is it to be bilingual? `valuable`

5. How important is it to not have an accent when speaking a second language? (reverse code) `no_accent`


```{r, include=FALSE}
rating_ver = td %>% 
  filter(question_type == "most_interested_qs") %>% 
  group_by(version) %>% 
  summarise(n_t = n())


impcheck = td %>% 
  filter(question_type == "most_interested_qs") 

pct_df_preq = td %>% 
  filter(question_type == "most_interested_qs") %>% 
  group_by(version, rating) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  left_join(rating_ver) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n/n_t)
```

```{r, 'pct1', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The percentage of each rating by test type"}
pct_df_preq %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = pct, x = rating, fill = as.factor(version))) + 
  geom_col(color = "black", position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#71797E", "seagreen")) +
  facet_wrap(~version) + theme_apa() + xlab("Rating choice") +
  ylab("Percentage of Ratings")
```
